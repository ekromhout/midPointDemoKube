#This is a set of scripts to
#copy the complex midPoint demo
#into a Kubernetes cluster

#This depends on a docker-compose build
#already having been run in order
#to build the populated volumes
#via container layers that aren't
#part of the end system. 
#I'll be working on using init containers
#or some other method to eliminate that
#dependency.

#The original complex demo with the
#docker-compose is located here
#https://github.internet2.edu/docker/midPoint_container.git
#and is not copied in this project

#The build.sh is a wrapper scripts for
#all the other .sh scripts that are filled
#with the needed kubectl commands
